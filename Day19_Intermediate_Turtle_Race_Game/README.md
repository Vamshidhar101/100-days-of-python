## 🚀 How It Works
1. The program sets up six turtles of different colors on the starting line.
2. The player places a bet by entering the color of the turtle they think will win.
3. A **randomized race** begins where turtles move forward by random steps.
4. A **finish line** is drawn, and the first turtle to cross it wins.
5. The program announces whether the player won or lost based on their bet.
