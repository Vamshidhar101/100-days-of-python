# 🌅 Day 33 – Sunrise & Sunset Email Notifier  

This project fetches **sunrise and sunset times** for Ludhiana (or any city by latitude & longitude) using the [Sunrise-Sunset API](https://sunrise-sunset.org/api).  
It then converts the times from **UTC to IST**, displays them in the terminal, and sends them as a neat **email report** using Python’s `smtplib`.
