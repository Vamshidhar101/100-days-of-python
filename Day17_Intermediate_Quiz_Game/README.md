# 🧠 Day 17 – Quiz Game (OOP)

A fun True/False quiz game built using **Object-Oriented Programming** in Python.  
The program asks random trivia questions and tracks your score until you complete the game.

---

## 🚀 How It Works
1. The program loads a set of 30 True/False questions from `data.py`.
2. Each question is converted into a `Question` object (`question_model.py`).
3. The `QuizBrain` class (`quiz_brain.py`) manages:
   - Asking questions one by one.
   - Taking user input (True/False).
   - Checking correctness.
   - Updating and displaying the score.
4. The game continues until all questions are asked.
5. At the end, it shows your **final score**.

## 🛠 Skills Used
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**  
  - Classes & Objects (`Question`, `QuizBrain`)  
  - Encapsulation & attributes management  
- **Modular Code Structure** (`data.py`, `question_model.py`, `quiz_brain.py`, `main.py`)  
- **User Input Handling**  
- **Conditionals & Loops** for game flow  
- **Score Tracking System**
