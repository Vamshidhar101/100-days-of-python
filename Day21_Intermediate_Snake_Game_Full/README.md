# 🐍 Day 21 – Snake Game (Intermediate)

Classic Snake Game built with Python's **turtle** graphics module.  
I improved my earlier version (Day 20) by completing the full gameplay loop:  
snake movement, food spawning, scoring, collisions, and game over screen.  

---

## 🚀 How It Works
1. The snake starts with 3 segments and moves automatically.
2. Use the **arrow keys** to control the snake's direction.
3. Eat the blue food to grow and increase your score.
4. The game ends if:
   - The snake hits a wall ❌
   - The snake collides with its own tail ❌
5. Final score is displayed when the game ends.
