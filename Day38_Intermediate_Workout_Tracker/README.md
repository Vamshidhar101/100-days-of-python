# 🏋️ Day 38 – Workout Tracker with Google Sheets

Track your workouts using the **Nutritionix API** and automatically log them into **Google Sheets** via the Sheety API.

---

## 🚀 How It Works
1. The program asks you: **“💪 What exercises did you do today?”**
2. Your response (e.g., "ran 3 miles and did 20 pushups") is sent to the **Nutritionix API**, which returns calories burned, duration, etc.
3. The program records:
   - Date 🗓️
   - Time ⏰
   - Exercise 🏋️
   - Duration ⏱️
   - Calories 🔥  
   into your **Google Sheet** using Sheety API.
4. You now have a personal fitness tracker, automatically updating your sheet!
