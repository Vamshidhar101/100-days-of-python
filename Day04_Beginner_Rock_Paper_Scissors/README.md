# ðŸŽ® Day 4 â€“ Rock Paper Scissors

A beginner-friendly Python game that lets you play Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer with ASCII art for each choice.

## ðŸš€ How It Works
1. Ask the user to choose:
   - **0** for Rock  
   - **1** for Paper  
   - **2** for Scissors
2. Generate a random choice for the computer.
3. Display both choices using ASCII art.
4. Compare choices and decide the result:
   - Win
   - Lose
   - Draw

## ðŸ›  Skills Used
- Variables
- Lists
- Random Module (`random.randint`)
- Conditional Statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
- ASCII Art Formatting
