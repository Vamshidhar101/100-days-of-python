# 🃏 Day 11 – Blackjack  

A simple text-based **Blackjack game** built in Python. The player competes against the computer to get as close to **21** as possible without going over.  

---

## 🚀 How It Works  
1. You and the computer each get **two cards**.  
2. `Ace (11)` automatically adjusts to `1` if your total goes over 21.  
3. Blackjack (`21 with 2 cards`) is an instant win!  
4. You can either:  
   - Type **'y'** to draw another card  
   - Type **'n'** to pass your turn  
5. The computer will draw cards until it reaches **17 or higher**.  
6. Scores are compared and the winner is declared.
