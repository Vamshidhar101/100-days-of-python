# 🃏 Day 31 – Flash Card App (French-English)

A smart flashcard learning app built with **Tkinter** and **Pandas**.  
Helps you memorize French words by flipping cards automatically after a few seconds!

---

## 🚀 How It Works
1. A French word appears on the front of a flashcard.
2. After 3 seconds, the card flips to show its English translation.
3. ✅ Click the "Right" button if you knew the word – it gets removed from future practice.  
   ❌ Click the "Wrong" button to keep it in the pool for more revision.
4. Your progress is saved in `words_to_learn.csv` so you don’t repeat mastered words.

## 🛠 Skills Used
- Python **Tkinter** (GUI programming)
- **Pandas** for CSV data handling
- Random module for word selection
- File persistence for tracking progress
