# ðŸš´ Day 37 â€“ Cycling Graph with Pixela API

Track your daily cycling distance visually using the **Pixela API**.  
This project logs your activity as a pixel graph online and allows updates for any day.

---

## ðŸš€ How It Works
1. **Setup Graph** â€“ Run once to create your cycling graph on Pixela.  
2. **Add Pixel** â€“ Each day, input how many kilometers you cycled, and it logs the entry.  
3. **Update Pixel** â€“ If needed, update the logged distance for the current day.  
4. **View Progress** â€“ Open your Pixela graph link to see your cycling journey visually.
