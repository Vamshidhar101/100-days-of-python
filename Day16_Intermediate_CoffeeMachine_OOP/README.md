# â˜• Day 16 â€“ Coffee Machine (OOP Version)

A coffee machine simulation built with **Object-Oriented Programming** in Python. It handles orders, checks resources, processes payments, and makes coffee â€“ just like a real vending machine!

---

## ðŸš€ How It Works
1. The machine displays available drinks (`espresso / latte / cappuccino`).
2. User selects a drink or types:
   - `report` â†’ Shows resources & profit.  
   - `off` â†’ Turns the machine off.
3. Machine checks if enough resources are available.
4. Handles coin input and verifies if payment is sufficient.
5. Deducts resources and dispenses the coffee â˜•.

## ðŸ›  Skills Used
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** â†’ Classes & Objects  
- **Encapsulation** of functionality into modules (`Menu`, `CoffeeMaker`, `MoneyMachine`)  
- **Abstraction** with clean methods (`make_payment()`, `is_resource_sufficient()`)  
- **Control Flow** (loops, conditionals)  
- **Dynamic Input Handling** (`get_items()`, `find_drink()`)  
- **Modular Code Design** â€“ separate files for readability & reusability
