# 💰 Day 9 – Secret Auction  

A fun program that simulates a **silent auction** where multiple bidders can place their bids secretly, and the program announces the winner with the highest bid.  

---

## 🚀 How It Works  
1. Each bidder enters their **name** and **bid amount**.  
2. The program stores all bids in a dictionary.  
3. After all bidders have entered, the screen is cleared to keep bids secret.  
4. Once bidding ends, the program finds the **highest bidder**.  
5. The winner’s name and bid amount are displayed.

## 🛠 Skills Used  
- **Dictionaries** for storing name–bid pairs 📝  
- **Loops** (`while`) for continuous bidding 🔄  
- **Functions** for modular code (clear screen & highest bidder logic) ⚡  
- **Conditionals** (`if-else`) for program decisions ✅  
- **os module** for clearing the console 🖥️
