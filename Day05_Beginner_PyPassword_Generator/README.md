# 🔐 Day 5 – PyPassword Generator

A secure password generator that creates strong, randomized passwords using letters, numbers, and symbols based on user preferences.

## 🚀 How It Works
1. User specifies:
   - Number of **letters**.
   - Number of **symbols**.
   - Number of **numbers**.
2. Program randomly selects characters from predefined lists for each category.
3. Combines all characters into a list.
4. Shuffles the list to ensure maximum randomness.
5. Joins and displays the final password.

## 🛠 Skills Used
- For loops & list comprehensions
- `random.choice()` and `random.shuffle()`
- String manipulation
- User input handling
