# 🧠 Day 34 – Quiz App with GUI

A true/false quiz game powered by the Open Trivia DB API, built with `tkinter` for a clean and interactive GUI.

---

## 🚀 How It Works
1. Fetches 10 True/False questions from the [Open Trivia Database](https://opentdb.com/).
2. Displays one question at a time inside the GUI.
3. Player selects **True ✅** or **False ❌**.
4. Immediate feedback is given with color highlights:
   - Green for correct
   - Red for incorrect
5. Score is tracked and displayed dynamically.
6. When all questions are answered, the final score is shown.
