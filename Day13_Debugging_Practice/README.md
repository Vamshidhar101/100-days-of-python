# 🐞 Day 13 – Debugging Practice  

Today’s challenge was about **debugging broken programs**.  
I worked on fixing three classic exercises: **Odd or Even, Leap Year, and FizzBuzz**.  

---

## 🚀 How It Works  
1. Start with buggy scripts (wrong syntax, logic, or operators).  
2. Run and analyze error messages.  
3. Debug step by step.  
4. Compare original vs corrected versions.

## 🛠 Skills Used  
- Reading error messages effectively  
- Fixing logical & syntax errors  
- Debugging classic coding exercises (Odd/Even, Leap Year, FizzBuzz)  
- Strengthening problem-solving skills
