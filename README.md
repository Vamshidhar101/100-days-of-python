#  💻 100 Days of Python 🐍🔥

Welcome to my **#100DaysOfPython** challenge!  
In this journey, I'm diving deep into Python — one day, one project at a time — to sharpen my skills, explore real-world applications, and have some coding fun! 🎯

> 🚀 _"Consistency is more important than intensity. Every day adds up."_


## 📌 What is This?

Over the next 100 days, I’ll be building **mini-projects in Python**, each designed to improve my understanding of:
- 🔹 Core Python concepts
- 🔹 Logic building & problem solving
- 🔹 Real-world programming
- 🔹 AI/ML-readiness and automation

Whether you're a beginner or just exploring, feel free to explore each project and learn along with me!
