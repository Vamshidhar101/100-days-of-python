# 💯 100 Days of Python

Welcome to my **#100DaysOfPython** challenge!  
This repository documents my journey of building **100 Python mini-projects** in 100 days — one day at a time.

> 🚀 _"Consistency is more important than intensity. Every day adds up."_


## 📌 What is This?

Over the next 100 days, I’ll be building **mini-projects in Python**, each designed to improve my understanding of:
- 🔹 Core Python concepts
- 🔹 Logic building & problem solving
- 🔹 Real-world programming
- 🔹 AI/ML-readiness and automation

Whether you're a beginner or just exploring, feel free to explore each project and learn along with me!
