# â˜• Day 15 â€“ Coffee Machine (Intermediate Project)

A simulation of a coffee vending machine that handles orders, resources, and payments.

---

## ðŸš€ How It Works
1. User chooses a drink (`espresso`, `latte`, or `cappuccino`).
2. Program checks if resources are sufficient.
3. User inserts coins â†’ program calculates total.
4. If enough money is provided:
   - Gives change (if any).
   - Deducts resources.
   - Serves coffee â˜•
5. Special commands:
   - `report` â†’ shows remaining resources and profit.
   - `off` â†’ shuts down the machine.

## ðŸ›  Skills Used
- **Dictionaries & Nested Data Structures** for `MENU` and `resources`
- **Functions & Modular Code Design**
- **Loops & Conditionals**
- **State Management (resources & profit tracking)**
- **User Input Validation & Edge Case Handling**
