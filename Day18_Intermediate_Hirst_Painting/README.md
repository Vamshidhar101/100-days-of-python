# 🎨 Day 18 – Hirst Painting Project

A fun project using the Turtle graphics module to recreate Damien Hirst’s famous dot paintings with Python.

---

## 🚀 How It Works
1. Extracts RGB color values from an image using the `colorgram` library.  
2. Creates a list of color tuples.  
3. Uses the `turtle` module to draw a 10x10 grid of colorful dots.  
4. Each dot is randomly picked from the extracted colors.
