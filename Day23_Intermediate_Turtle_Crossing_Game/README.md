# 🐢 Day 23 – Turtle Crossing Game (Intermediate)

Arcade-style game built with Python’s **turtle graphics** module.  
Help the turtle cross the busy road while avoiding cars 🚗💨.

## 🚀 How It Works
1. **Controls:**
   - Move Up → `↑` (Up Arrow Key)  
2. Cars spawn randomly and drive across the screen.  
3. Reach the top safely to **level up** – cars move faster each round.  
4. Collision with a car ends the game.  
5. The goal is to reach the **highest level possible** before getting hit!
