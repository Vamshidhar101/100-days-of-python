# ðŸŽ® Day 7 â€“ Hangman Game  

A fun command-line **Hangman game** where you guess letters to reveal the hidden word before running out of lives! âš¡  

---

## ðŸš€ How It Works  
1. The game randomly selects a word from a word list.  
2. You guess one letter at a time.  
3. Correct guesses reveal the letters in the word.  
4. Wrong guesses reduce your lives and draw the hangman.  
5. The game ends when you either guess the full word or lose all your lives.
