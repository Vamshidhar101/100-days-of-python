## 🚀 How It Works
1. User inputs the first number.
2. Program displays available operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).
3. User picks an operation and enters the second number.
4. Program calculates and prints the result.
5. User can:
   - Type `'y'` → continue with the current result,
   - Type `'n'` → start a new calculation,
   - Type `'q'` → quit the program.
