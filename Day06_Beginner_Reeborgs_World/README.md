# 🤖 Day 6 – Reeborg’s World Challenges  

Today I solved multiple challenges in **Reeborg’s World** including Hurdle problems and the Maze problem. These puzzles focus on using **loops, conditionals, and problem-solving logic** in Python.  

---

## 🚀 How It Works  
1. **Hurdle 1** – Jump over fixed hurdles using `while` loop.  
2. **Hurdle 2** – Solve hurdles with random lengths using `while` and `if`.  
3. **Hurdle 3** – Handle unknown number of hurdles until reaching the goal.  
4. **Hurdle 4** – Handle both variable wall heights and random hurdle numbers.  
5. **Maze** – Solve the maze using the “right-hand rule” algorithm.
