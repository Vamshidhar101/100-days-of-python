# 🏓 Day 22 – Pong Game

Classic Pong arcade game recreated with Python’s **turtle** graphics module.  
Two paddles, a bouncing ball, and a scoreboard – simple yet addictive!  

---

## 🚀 How It Works
1. **Controls:**
   - Left Paddle → `W` (up), `S` (down)  
   - Right Paddle → `↑` (up), `↓` (down)  
2. Hold the keys for continuous paddle movement.  
3. The ball bounces off the walls and paddles.  
4. Missing the ball gives a point to the opponent.  
5. First player to **10 points** wins the game.
